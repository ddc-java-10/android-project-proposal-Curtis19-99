## Summary

The purpose of this app is to create a rhyme generator for when you freestyle and you get stuck, or run out of rhymes and need ideas. This app will rhyme single words or last words of sentences to keep in the format of freestyling. It will also have a random rhyme generator to help stimulate ideas and subject matter to rap about.

## Intended users

1. For anyone who enjoys to freestyle rap, but recognizes that sometimes you just need help rhyming certain words together. 
	>As someone who enjoys freestyling, I would find useful an app that helps me when I get stuck or rhyme myself into a corner.

2. Anyone that needs a simple rhyme generator for any reason.
	>This could be for anyone who just needs something to imput a word and a rhyme will come out. 

3. Somebody freestyling who has ran out of ideas and topics to rhyme about.
	>As someone who freestyle's with friends a lot we can rap for a while. The issue with rapping for long periods of time is that the subject matter that came off the top of your head can get a little stale. This app would satisfy that by having a random rhyme and topic generator to give you ideas on what to continue rapping about. 

## Functionality
