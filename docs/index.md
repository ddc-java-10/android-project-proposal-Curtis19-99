## Summary

The purpose of this app is to create a rhyme generator for when you freestyle and you get stuck, or run out of rhymes and need ideas. This app will rhyme single words or last words of sentences to keep in the format of freestyling. It will also have a random rhyme generator to help stimulate ideas and subject matter to rap about.

## Intended users

* For anyone who enjoys to freestyle rap, but recognizes that sometimes you just need help rhyming certain words together. 
	>As someone who enjoys freestyling, I would find useful an app that helps me when I get stuck or rhyme myself into a corner.

* Anyone that needs a simple rhyme generator for any reason.
	>This could be for anyone who just needs something to imput a word and a rhyme will come out. 

* Somebody freestyling who has ran out of ideas and topics to rhyme about.
	>As someone who freestyle's with friends a lot we can rap for a while. The issue with rapping for long periods of time is that the subject matter that came off the top of your head can get a little stale. This app would satisfy that by having a random rhyme and topic generator to give you ideas on what to continue rapping about. 

## Functionality

The user will be able to enter in single or double words and it will bring up words that rhyme with it.

The user will be able to enter in lines of words or "bars" and it will take the last word and rhyme it together keeping the format of freestlying. 

The user will be able to hit a random idea button and it will bring up two options. A topic or a word to rhyme with. 

(optional not sure how this will work yet) The user can say a word into the microphone and it will bring up rhyme generations based on the spoken word. This could also be done with phrases or "bars" using the last word to generate a rhyme. 

I would like to impliment Markov Chains to try and have a predict feature to continually generate rhymes of one another.
